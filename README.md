## ‚≠ê About the Project

This repository contains the docker-compose files, configurations and other requirements to launch the entire BikePack project.

## 	üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

<!-- Prerequisites -->
### ‚ÄºÔ∏è Prerequisites

Running the project requires docker to launch all the services. The docker-compose files will pull the containers from the github container repository, this requires docker to be authenticated with github.

The authentication service requires a `serviceKey.json` file in the root of this repository to run. This is the service key that can be gotten from firebase to authenticate the authentication-service with firebase.

<!-- Run Locally -->
### üèÉ Run Locally

The easiest way to run the project is using `make` and the commands in the make file. These will run all commands that are required to launch different parts of the project.

#### Running the base project

using make:
```bash
make launch
```

using docker-compose:

```bash
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml pull && \
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.yml -p bikepack up
```

#### Running the eindhoven service area

using make:
```bash
make launch-ehv
```

using docker-compose:
```bash
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.area-specific.yml pull && \
docker compose  --env-file .\service-areas\ehv\docker-compose.env -f .\docker-compose.area-specific.yml -p bikepack-ehv up --build --no-recreate
```

### ‚ûï Adding additional service-areas

This repository comes with two service-areas (Eindhoven, Amsterdam). To add additional service-areas you need to do the following:

#### Create docker compose .env file

The area specific containers run with the config files found under the ./service-areas folder. Using docker-compose .env files certain configurations are overridden to specify which service-area the container is part of. To create a new service-area create a .env file with the following fields:

```env
SERVICEAREA_ID=1                                            # ID of the service area
SERVICEAREA_IDENTIFIER=ehv                                  # Identifier used for the service area

DB_USER=user                                                # Database username
DB_PASSWORD=password                                        # Database password
DB_PORT=5431                                                # Database port
DB_INIT=./infrastructure/service-areas/postgres-initdb      # Database initialization scripts
```

After you have your .env file you can run the new containers using docker-compose. For this use the following commands:

```bash
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.area-specific.yml pull && \
docker compose  --env-file {YOUR_ENV_FILE_PATH} -f .\docker-compose.area-specific.yml -p bikepack-{SERVICEAREA_IDENTIFIER} up --build --no-recreate
```

This will launch the parcel and delivery service for this service-area and the required database. The new endpoints are automatically added to the API-gateway.
